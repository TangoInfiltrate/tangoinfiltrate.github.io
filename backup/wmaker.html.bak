<h1>Window Maker<span class="timestamp">22.3.2024</span></h1>
<p>
My favorite things on Linux are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_2">GNOME2</a>
and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_Maker">Window Maker</a>,
the former of which was not kept around properly, and to use that these days, you have to maintain all of its former glory yourself.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_MATE">MATE</a>
tried to stick to its guns during the early days by holding onto the original GUI; however, it was not hard-headed enough to continue doing so, hehehe.
All of this is rather okay, because i like Window Maker way more due to its consistently good design.
Its principles are to keep everything the same in how it looks and behaves, both of which are important human elements for extensive computer usage and for retaining users and staying relevant to the original sensibilities.
<br>
<br>
These kinds of considerations, i present here, can save you time in the long run and give you a sense of conceptual ownership of your computing ways, even when you go through some slight trials and tribulations.
While i, myself, will never spend more than a few minutes here and there configuring the look of a workspace; i still hold onto some UI principles that i really look for in my everyday Linux experience 
that can make it feel and behave in a way that clicks with all of my being.
<br>
<br>
Here, below, i share some screenshots and documents that could be helpful and show one way of using Linux. At the very least i have a roof to package everything under.
</p>


<h1>Lazarus<span class="timestamp">25.3.2024</span></h1>
<p>
I should talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(software)">Lazarus</a>,
because that is what powers a lot of the work I do. Some call it an IDE, but I'm way past that
point and have since started calling it the programmer's dojo. Below you can take a look at
a screenshot that shows the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG">WYSIWYG</a>
editor that I dirtied up with some basic controls.
<br>
<br>
Now, you may be asking, why, exactly, am I drawing analogies between real-life elements like
a place dedicated to training in martial arts and technical tools? Well, my answer to that is
that conceptually, if you think about it, Lazarus gives you the equivalent of tools, like
training dummies, and then there are the real hitters hanging around, as well as a cohesive training regimen
with its plethora of material out there.
<br>
<br>
Then when's all said and done, you end up venturing out to fight some baddies with the tools and techniques
that you received throughout your stay there. That is not to say that you ever want to leave the IDE, just that
you can package everything up and keep it in your back pocket whenever you need any of those things in another
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Pascal">Free Pascal</a>
program, or even if you want to go write
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>,
then come back and call that code from where you left off.

<br>
<br>
It bears mentioning that Lazarus is not exactly the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gohan">Gohan</a>
to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goku">Goku</a> ,
in terms of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)">Delphi</a>, an IDE that originated in the nineties,
but more like the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegeta">Vegeta</a>
to Goku.

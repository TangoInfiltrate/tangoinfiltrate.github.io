<h1>The Tuxedo <span class="timestamp">22.3.2024</span></h1>
<p>
I wanted to gather up some footage and docs of tools i use on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_Maker">Window Maker</a>, 
because i was going through the effort
of organizing and updating those docs (among other things) during the last couple of days. So, might as well share some of that work
<a href="wmaker.html">here</a>. 
The first batch of updates will mostly be on 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Commander">Double Commander</a>, 
because i always knew that it uses 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_(software)">Lazarus</a>, 
and so do i. Therefore, it can be interesting to show a fully featured program and a great file explorer at that, which was also made in it.

<h1>Thirdperson camera <span class="timestamp">7.3.2024</span></h1>
<p>
I wrote a thirdperson camera with a steerable figure, represented as a little 3D locator.
There are now dedicated pages for individual projects and the first one is for the
<a href="shouldercam.html">assets</a>
released today.

<p>
<a href="https://codeberg.org/TangoInfiltrator/spectator/releases/download/spectator/spectator1.7z">Here</a> 
is a firstperson spectator, that's written in <u>Lazarus</u> using my library called <u>UtilBoy</u> and 
<a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/OpenGL#OpenGL_units_in_Lazarus">OpenGL</a>. 
There is more code yet to be released for the library itself, 
and I will continue to work on it as long as it sees use within my secret project. 
Now, please come back later and there may be more loot to pick up.
